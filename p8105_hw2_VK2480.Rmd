## Library calls
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Problem 1

```{r}
# read csv file
nyc_transit_df = read_csv("NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
#clean names
nyc_transit_df = janitor::clean_names(nyc_transit_df)
```
```{r}
# retain certain columns in df
nyc_transit_df = nyc_transit_df %>% select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, entrance_type, vending, ada) 
```

```{r}
# recode entry variable from character to logical type
nyc_transit_df$entry = ifelse(nyc_transit_df$entry =="YES", TRUE, FALSE)
```
```{r}
#Write a short paragraph about this dataset â€“ explain briefly what variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset. Are these data tidy?
```

```{r}
#Q: How many distinct stations are there? 
nyc_transit_df %>% 
distinct(line, station_name) %>% 
count()
#A: There are 465 distinct stations in NYC. 
```

```{r}
#Q: How many stations are ADA compliant?
nyc_transit_df %>% 
filter(ada == "TRUE") %>% 
distinct(line, station_name) %>%
count()
#A: 84 stations are ADA compliant. 
```
```{r}
#Q: What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?
nyc_transit_df %>% 
filter(vending == "YES") %>%
count(entry) %>%
mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
#A: 99.94% of station entrances / exits without vending vending allow entrance.
```

```{r}
#Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct variables.
## DOUBT!!!
#Q:How many distinct stations serve the A train? 
nyc_transit_df %>%
filter(route1 == "A") %>%
distinct(line, station_name) %>%
count()
#A: 60 distinct stations serve the A train. 
```
```{r}
#Q: Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?
nyc_transit_df %>%
filter(route1 == "A") %>%
filter(ada == "TRUE") %>%
distinct(line, station_name) %>%
count()
#A: Of the 60 stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant. 
```
